Finance App
This project is a simple finance app that provides two calculators: a loan calculator and a savings calculator. It allows users to input loan details such as loan amount, interest rate, and term to calculate monthly payments, total payments, and total interest. Similarly, users can input initial savings, annual interest rate, and time period to calculate future value and total interest earned.

Features
Loan Calculator: Calculates monthly payments, total payments, and total interest for a loan based on user input.
Savings Calculator: Calculates future value and total interest earned for savings based on user input.
Clean and Intuitive UI: Each calculator has its own page with easy-to-use input fields and a clear display of calculation results.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Usage

Navigate between the pages using the navigation links.
Enter the required input values in the respective fields.
Click the "Calculate" button to see the calculation results.
